# MCN

TITLE: MCN : Melbourne Creative Network

PROGRESS: Not complete / WIP

THEME: An app where local Melbourne creatives can offer their services

IN DEPTH: I wanted to build a small app where creative people in the local Melbourne area can offer their services and network. Originally planned as a two sided marketplace for Coder Academy, but didn't fit the rubic criteria. I think the idea could benefit freelancers and local creatives, so I still want to finish off the project.

TOOLS: Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, Ruby 2.7.0
